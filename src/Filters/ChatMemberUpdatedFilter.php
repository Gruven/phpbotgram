/**
 * Dispatcher-side filter that matches a `ChatMemberUpdated` event by
 * comparing the wire-level statuses of `old_chat_member` and `new_chat_member`.
 *
 * Port of `aiogram.filters.chat_member_updated.ChatMemberUpdatedFilter`
 * (`aiogram/filters/chat_member_updated.py:192-219`).
 *
 * # Aiogram DSL → PHP factories
 *
 * Upstream exposes a Python-only operator DSL on `_MemberStatusMarker`
 * instances:
 *
 *   KICKED | LEFT >> +MEMBER          # was kicked/left, now member
 *   JOIN_TRANSITION  = IS_NOT_MEMBER >> IS_MEMBER
 *   LEAVE_TRANSITION = ~JOIN_TRANSITION
 *   PROMOTED_TRANSITION = (MEMBER | RESTRICTED | LEFT | KICKED) >> ADMINISTRATOR
 *
 * PHP can't reuse `|` / `>>` / `~` between class instances (operator
 * overloading is limited to a handful of arithmetic methods on numeric
 * objects via `Pure\Math`). The port replaces the operator DSL with two
 * surfaces:
 *
 *   1. Direct constructor / `transition()`: explicit `oldStatuses` and
 *      `newStatuses` arrays of wire-level status strings.
 *   2. Named pre-built factories — `join()`, `leave()`, `promotion()`,
 *      `demotion()` — mirroring upstream's `JOIN_TRANSITION` /
 *      `LEAVE_TRANSITION` / `PROMOTED_TRANSITION` constants and a
 *      reverse-promotion pre-built. The `+`/`-` `is_member` modifier on
 *      `RESTRICTED` (upstream's `IS_MEMBER` includes `+RESTRICTED`,
 *      `IS_NOT_MEMBER` includes `-RESTRICTED`) is collapsed: restricted
 *      users count as members for the named factories. Callers that need
 *      the finer-grained `is_member` gate can build a transition by hand
 *      and post-filter on `oldChatMember->isMember` / `newChatMember->isMember`
 *      via a Logic AND combinator.
 *
 * # Reading `status` off `ChatMember`
 *
 * The abstract `ChatMember` parent does NOT declare a `status` property —
 * each concrete subclass (`ChatMemberOwner`, `ChatMemberAdministrator`,
 * `ChatMemberMember`, `ChatMemberRestricted`, `ChatMemberLeft`,
 * `ChatMemberBanned`) carries its own `public readonly string $status`
 * defaulted to the discriminator value. The filter resolves the wire
 * string via a static `match`-on-class helper so PHPStan level 9 stays
 * happy without a `@property` declaration on the abstract parent.
 *
 * # Return shape
 *
 * Pure `bool`. The filter contributes no kwargs to the handler — upstream's
 * `__call__` returns plain `bool` for matching/non-matching transitions.
